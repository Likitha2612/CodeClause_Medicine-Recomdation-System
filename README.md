The recent talk of the town among Cancer Researchers is how treating diseases like Cancer using Genetic Testing will be a revolution in the universe of Cancer Research. 
This dreamy revolution has been partially realized because of the significant efforts of clinical pathologists. 
The pathologist first sequences a cancer tumour gene and then figures out the interpretation of genetic mutations manually. 
This is quite a tedious process and takes a lot of time as the pathologist has to go look for evidence in clinical literature to derive interpretations. 
But, this process can be made smooth if we implement Machine Learning algorithms.
